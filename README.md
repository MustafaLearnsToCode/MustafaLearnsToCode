**MustafaLearnsToCode/MustafaLearnsToCode** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a '100 days of code' by Angela Yu
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data analysis and math-driven projects
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with applying coding to real-world problems
- âš¡ Fun fact: My favourite debugging method is...print()
